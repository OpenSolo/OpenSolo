# Solo Builder #
The solo-builder will create file system images for the Solo's IMX and the controller's IMX. The Open Solo vagrant virual machine is used for the build environment. The vagrant VM used for solo-builder is also used for the Artoo STM32 firmware builder. So if you already installed and setup the VM for artoo, you can skip right to executing the build.
