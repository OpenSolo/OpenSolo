939786f8 Merge pull request #111 from Susurrus/language_loading
85d610bf Defer loading all language-specific generators until they are actually chosen. This does a couple of things: 1) Problems with language-specific generators will not break usage for other languages 2) Slight speed up and memory savings as less Python code is included.
c8347c61 mavgen.py now uses the Choices type for optparse. This allows for more sensible errors. It also moves the language name checking towards the start, speeding up feedback and simplifying later code.
